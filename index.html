        <p class="firstPara">Overpopulation of animals is a phenomenon when the number of any given species increases to an alarming extent and the ecosystem fails to support the survival of its inhabitants.</p>
        <p class="secondPara">It is a pressing issue for the entire planet as the exceeding burden of overpopulated species create turbulence in the cosmic harmony of living things.<br>
            <br>Animal “overpopulation” occurs due to many reasons:
            <br>1. allowing animals to reproduce with little to no chance of finding homes for the little ones, and
            <br>2. Owners abandoning pets because they no longer want them around.<br>
            <br>The failure to understand how a single litter of puppies or cats can potentially produce hundreds of offspring results in a terrible outcome of overflow and, consequently, animal euthanasia.
